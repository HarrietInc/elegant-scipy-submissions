Repository to track code submissions the _Elegant SciPy_ book

## "What's this all about?"

We (@hdashnow, @stefanv, and @jni) are writing an O'Reilly book called _Elegant
SciPy_. It aims to teach fledgling Pythonistas to take their scientific
programming to the next level, using the most elegant SciPy code examples we
can find.

This is where you come in: if you've ever come across a really great piece of
code using the [SciPy library](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/), please submit it
by [creating a new issue in this repo!](https://github.com/HarrietInc/elegant-scipy-submissions/issues/new)

Have a look at the
[existing issues](https://github.com/HarrietInc/elegant-scipy-submissions/issues)
for inspiration!

## "Wait wait wait... I want to know more."

Sure! We've written about this in @jni's blog:
